The long ATMs queues are becoming a rare sight. Shopkeepers, cab drivers, and street vendor are switching over to digital payments.</p><p>So, what happened? Why was there a sudden surge in digital transactions? And what does the future hold?</p><h2>Facts and Figures</h2><p>At the present rate of shift towards digital payment systems; 3 in every 4 transactions will be digital by 2025. This sudden momentum can be seen as a result of increasing technological advances in the financial system and events like demonetization and COVID lockdown which acted as a catalyst. The speed, safety, ease of payments attracts vendors and consumers equally.</p><p>Though the currency circulation was increased by 19.1 % in 2019 from the 2016 levels, the RBI norms on withdrawal limits, tariffs on ATM withdrawals, and intensive marketing campaigns by fintech companies has made India the top country in digital transactions by volume.</p><p>The most preferred form of digital payment presently is UPI (Unified Payment Interface) by debit/credit cards. The year 2020 marked a new record for UPI transactions in India. The total UPI transactions in 2020 reached the figure of 4,16,000 crores in 2020 which was a two-fold increase from the transactions in 2019. The pandemic forced many people to be accustomed to these formats, still it’s something that will benefit the economy in long run.</p><h2>Going Forward</h2><p>What does the future hold for digital payment? That&#39;s a really difficult question to answer, but it is sure that we’re not going back to the paper currency age.</p>`,

With this realization, India, in the past 5-6 years, has seen a huge shift in the payment modes.</em></p><p>Around 39% of the retail transactions in India are done digitally, and this percentage is on the rise. Let’s look at the systems that are slowly replacing paper currency.</p><h2 id="debit-credit-cards">Debit/Credit Cards</h2><p> It is currently the most popular mode of payment in India. The reason behind this can be attributed to the safety, ease, and, accessibility in both online and offline modes. </p><h2 id="upi">UPI</h2><p>UPI stands for Unified Payments Interface. After debit/credit cards, UPI is the most popular mode of payments in India.</p><p>Launched in 2016, UPI has exponentially grown with a CAGR of 414%, clocking 1246 million transactions in March 2020. Since the imposition of lockdown last year, the number went to an all-time high of 1800 million in September 2020.</p><p>This can be seen as a result of the ease of the payments on these platforms as well as the tremendous marketing campaigns by the companies.</p><h2 id="aadhar-enabled-payment-system">Aadhar Enabled Payment System</h2><p>Under this, the Aadhar holder can transfer money from his Aadhar linked bank account to any other Aadhar linked bank account. Although India&#39;s 98% population already has an Aadhar card, it is still not quite popular.</p><p>Till February 2020, the transaction count of AEPS had crossed more than 205 million, according to NPCI.</p>`,
